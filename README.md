### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a variety of items.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning anything that I can get my hands on, but particularly web-related items.
- ğŸ‘¯ Collaboration? I don't know much, but I'll give it a go!
- ğŸ¤” Help is always appreciated (and returned if possible).
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about music, or don't. It's a personal preference.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: This repo, for now.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him (but don't hesitate to just say _hey_ if that's your cup of :tea: or :coffee:).
- âš¡ Fun fact: A musician by training, but eager to learn pretty much anything that's required to get the job done!
